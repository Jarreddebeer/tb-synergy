### Useful bits
FIC := Fractional inhibitory concentration
MIC := minimum inhibitory concentrations
FIC index = `FIX_x + FIC_y = \frac{X}{MIC_x} + \frac{Y}{MIC_y}` where `X,Y` are
the dosages of drugs x,y.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are defined as the lowest concentration
of an antimicrobial that will inhibit the visible growth of a microorganism
after overnight incubation
