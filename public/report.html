# Visualising Synergistic drug combinations for tuberculosis therapy


three drugs tested in combination:

- RIF (rifampicin)
- INH (isoniazid)
- FA (fusidic acid)

Five plates set up, each compromised 2-fold dilutions of RIF down the columns, and 2-fold dilutions of INH across the rows.

FA was added at specific concentration for each of 4 plates while the fifth plate in the stack contained 0 ug/ul.

The values are fluorescence intensities from a green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter that is expressed in the bacterium. The maximum signal (i.e. uninhibited growth) is set at a limit of 65000.

## Problem

- status quo: drug combinations are only tested late in the drug discovery process
- solution: test drug combinations from earliest point
- new problem: TB is treated with combinations of 3 or 4 drugs at a time, visualising four dimensional data is difficult for those without CS degrees (and, it turns out, those with one too)

## Data

Intensities of Green Flourescent Protein in bacterium on 6 plates, divided into cells.

Each cell contains a range of dilutions of
RIF, INH, each plate has a different dilution of FA.

For computer scientists: 4-tuples, first three entries are dosages and the third is the drug’s “efficacy”. 

## Objective

Overall: find the combination of drugs that provides the greatest effect at the lowest dosage.

Two stages:
- Data exploration: what happened?
- Data presentation: how do I communicate it?

## Visual Queries

- Where is the "frontier"? (values with the lowest dosage that's effective).
- Which drugs are most effective on their own/in a pair?
- Are there any adversarial interactions?
- Is a drug active by itself?

## Our Ideas

The experiment is restricted to three drugs, due to physical limitations in conducting the experiment and
also for a simpler analysis of the results. The three drugs can easily be represented in three dimensional (3D)
space, and we began to explore 3D visualisations. Although these are a good starting point, one needs to be
careful as to how the fourth variable, the intensity of the Green Flourescent Protein (grp) is represented.
A naive selection of 3D visualisation may not support the visual query for detecting this intensity, but instead
hide it. A common visualisation used to represent four dimensional data is a 3D surface diagram **[see figure below]** where colour is
used on the surface itself to represent the fourth variable - much like a heatmap. We discovered that this
type of visualisation was in fact being used in reports to illustrate their results. There are many pitfalls
to this type of visualisation, one of them is that the surface occludes itself, hiding colours in the background.
The other is that it is very difficult to determine both the 3D coordinates of the point where a colour is
located on the surface, and the value of the actual colour! Another pitfall is that the surface is a continuous
interpolation of the discrete quantities, and we cannot tell which quantities were actually used.

[TODO: Figure number]

TODO: discuss 2D drawings

We began exploring other 3D visualisations, such as the 3D scatterplot **[See figure]**. This visualisation is
favourable to the 3D surface visualisation both because it does not occlude itself and because the scatter points
are discrete. However, on close inspection there are a few potential issues with visual queries. The first is that
the points are drawn without perspective (i.e from an orthographic projection) which provides no visual information
about where the point lies on the scatterplot. This is complicated further when points are clustered together.
It's worth noting here that an orthographic projection would actually be preferred to a perspective projection, which
distorts objects in the image with respect to distance. The use of an orthographic projection for this type of visualisation
is both a benefit and a hindrance. One solution to this problem is to draw lines from the points to the planes of the axes
**[as shown in figure]**, however this adds too much noise to the image, hampering visual queries.

![alt text][example-4d-visualisation_01]
![alt text][example-4d-visualisation_02]

We began to realise that a single 3D diagram would not be sufficient in analysing the results. Two dimensional
(2D) visualisations would likely be needed alongside a 3D diagram. This would allow us to keep the 3D visualisation simple
and use it, for example, in visual queries that compare the results of neighbouring points and plates (i.e. the physical space!).
The 2D visualisation could then be used for the variables most critical in decision making (i.e. the logic).

We identified the two variables critical to analysing the results, which would be used in the 2D visualisation. These are
the intensity of the Green Flourescent Protein (i.e. the Luminosity) and the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) **[describe this somewhere]**.
A 2D scatterplot would contain the visual queries needed to make accurate comparisons of all the cells, using
these two variables. We are interested in the point which has the lowest FIC value and the lowest Luminosity: a point very
close to the origin. This satisfies our logical decision making in identifying the best point from the experiment, all we
need is to map this 2D point back to the cell containing the 3 concentration values: a 3D point.

The 3D visualisation was then designed exactly for this mapping. It serves the visual queries which help to identify the
exact cell which we are interested in on the plates. Necessarily, it made sense to use the physical association of the cells
on plates in the visualisation. We chose to represent planes in the 3D space as the plates, stacked vertically on top of
one another. The concentration of Fusidic Acid (FA) only differs by plate, while the concentrations of Rifampicin (RIF)
and Isoniazid (INH) differ by cell. This makes the FA concentration a good candidate for the vertical distance between the
stacked plates, while RIF and INH are well suited for the two dimensions that define the plane.

The first design for the 3D visualisation used a physical association between the stacked planes and the plates.
A plane in 3D takes up zero space along its normal vector (the axis running perpendicularly through the plane),
whereas the plane itself is divided into non-zero square cells. This meant that the discrete values for RIF and INH
would be represented by cells with length of, say, Y that would span a 2D surface with area YxY.
In contrast, the discrete FA value would take up zero surface area. Our initial concern was that this discrepancy
in surface area taken up between the three drug concentrations would be misleading to the user, and for this
reason the first iteration of the design **[left on Figure below]** represented the points as cubes instead of planes.
The concentrations would then be represented equally in surface area.

![alt text][early-design-plate-iterations]

However, this introduced several issues. The most important issue is that it deviated from the physical association
of the plates. We had now also added more occlusion, which is most prominent on the lower lying plates since those have
similar concentration values. Deciding that the use of cubes with equal surface area was unjustified, the second iteration
used flat planes. This clearly simplifies the visual query, as the thickness of the planes is of no relevance, but we still
had an occlusion problem. Fortunately, the Luminosity values from the initial spreadsheet are either 65000 or range between 20000 and 23000.
This is an almost binary jump in value, indicating that the concentrations either have no effect at all or a similar effect.
For the most part we are not interested in concentrations which have no effect, so a slider was introduced to filter
these cells out of the visual query, and in so doing solve our occlusion problem.

The visualisation is also the subject of a similar issue to the discrepancy in surface area - a spatial discrepancy.
The squares in the plane represent the physical cells of the plate, and sit alongside one another regardless of the
difference in concentration to their neighbouring cells. At the same time the plates are vertically stacked with a
distance proportional to the FA concentration. A quick drawing was done to visualise what it would look like if we
were to separate the cells according to their spatial relativity, but this would clearly break down the physical
association completely and degrade the visualisation into a 3D scatterplot with squares as points - an issue in itself.

The proportional vertical stacking added no value to the physical association
intended for the visual query and still had the occlusion problem. As a result the design was refactored to use
uniform vertical spacing, obliterating the occlusion issue and associating plates in the order of their FA value.
**[See figures below]**

The final problem of colour differentiation would be tackled during implementation. With the designs of our 3D and
2D visualisations in place, we could focus on laying them both alongside one another. Since this was going to be
displayed on a web page, a simple web based grid layout was chosen **[See figure below]**.

the 2D scatterplot.
