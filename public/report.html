# Platevis: Visualising 3D Assays of Combinations for Tuberculosis Therapy

## Introduction

### Problems with researching TB

According to the (CDC)[http://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/], Tuberculosis (TB) one
of the most deadly diseases, with a third of the world's population infected.
It's an important disease in South Africa as it is the leading cause of death of
those who have HIV/AIDS. As such, it is important that effective drugs for its
treatment are discovered.

Developing drugs for TB is complex as it is treated with a combination of
medications rather than one on its own. This means that during drug discovery,
one cannot simply test the new drug on its own as it could have antagonistic
reactions with other drugs. This means that in order to see if a drug is
effective, you need to test it with a combination of drugs.

Usually this is done in the final stages of the drug's development in clinical
trials on human subjects. This is problematic however, because at this stage
large amounts of money has already been invested in the drug. If the drug has an
antagonistic interaction with any of the others in the standard treatements, then
it cannot be used. Recently some groups, such as UCT's
[IDM](http://www.idm.uct.ac.za/) have been testing drug combinations in the lab,
allowing much earlier detection of drug synergies and antagonisms. 

To compare two drugs, you use an assay depicted in Figure 1. For our data, an assay
is a series of petri dishes, each which contain a certain amount of TB treated a
certain concentration of two drugs. The concentration of the drugs in a given
dish is given by its position in the grid. The TB microbials are treated with a
compound which makes them give off light so you can measure a drug's efficacy by
determining how much light a dish is giving off. 

<center>

</center>

However, comparing two drugs is unfortunately not enough for emulating real
life conditions - treatment of TB consists of at least three drugs. This is done
with a 3D assay: you run multiple 2D assays each with a third drug with
different concentrations. This means that you essentially have four dimensional
data: each of the three drug concentrations and the luminosity of the plate.

Currently, researchers have no way to effectively visualise this 4D data,
slowing their research. As effective drugs can save the life of hundreds of
thousands, is is important they are able to grapple with this high dimensional
data.

### Data Provided

For our data, we are looking at three drugs in combination:
- rifampicin (RIF)
- isoniazid (INH)
- fusidic acid (FA)

Five plates were set up, each with different concentrations of RIF down the
columns and different concentrations of INH across the rows. FA was added at
specific concentration for each of 5 plates, with the first getting no FA and
the rest getting approximately double the concentration of the ones that
preceeded it.

The efficacy was measured with fluorescence intensities from a green fluorescent
protein (GFP) reporter that is expressed in the bacterium. The maximum signal
(i.e.  uninhibited growth) is set at a limit of 65000. 

The data is stored in spreadsheets depicted in Figure 2. Essentially, the data
is a four tuple: three concentrations and a measure of effectiveness from the
luminosity.

### Profile of Users

The design caters to two types of users which we profile briefly below. Both are
expected to be literate in the domain - they should understand the details of a
3D assay the what metrics to evaluate this data on. 

#### Professor Doctorson

Professor Doctorson has Doctorates in both Epidemiology and Virology.  She
manages dozens of laboratories all looking at multiple combinations of drugs
wants to be able to quickly understand whether a particular experiment was
successful in finding an effective treatment. She doesn't care about the
particular values, she just wants to be able to very easily get an overview of
the data that she can then include in a paper if it proves promising. 

#### Stu Dent

Stu is a masters student working in Professor Doctorson's lab. He is responsible
for running and evaluating the 3D assays that are being run. If Stu is able to
find an effective combination, he will be able to become fifth authour on one of
Prof. Doctorson's papers, so he is very invested in the detail of each
particular experiment. Stu wants to know how the experiment went as a whole but
also wants to be able to drill down and see any patterns. Once he has established
any patterns, Stu wants effective visualisations to be able to present them to
Professor Doctorson to illustrate them as quickly and effectively as possible.

## Related Work

### 2D Visualisations

Virologists use what are known as FIC curves to visualise the results of a
single assay as depicted in Figure 3. The points on the curves are the drug
combination in each row of the assay with the lowest FICs that inhibited the
growth of TB. This corresponds exactly to the rightmost dishes on the plate in
Figure 3. Researchers use this chart to determine the drug with the best FIC
index by finding the point closest to the origin as highlighted on the FIC
Curve.

The largest limitation of these diagrams is that they only show 2D data and do
extend naturally to 3D data. Even as a 2D visualisation, they have some problems
for data exploration as FIC curves hide data when they don't need to. One can
see a superset of information on the curve on the plates on the right as the
curve is simply the rightmost blue plate in each row. However the plates show
information the curve does not - how well each drug performs in isolation and
exactly how well each drug performs.

points on the FIC curve arise from, a FIC curve and the actual assay where the
data was sourced. Sourced from Digby Warner without attributation [2].

Figure 4 shows a star chart. These are good at showing data with a large number
of dimensions. Each point is a line and its value for each dimension is marked
by its distance from the origin on each of the marked dimension lines. 

This visualisation is effective at showing a small number of high dimesional
points as seen in Figure 4. However, our data has hundreds of points which if
displayed using this visualisation would make it hard to individual points and
trends. As this is important for our visual queries, it is unsuitable for our
current task.

<center>
![alt text][example-star-plot]

**Figure 4:** A star chart comparing space system designs [3].
</center>


Figure 5 shows a parallel coordinate plot. This is similar to a star plot in
that each point is a line and its value for a dimension is its height on a
dimension line. It's essentially a star chart whose lines have been made
parallel. The same criticisms of the star chart are valid for it: we simply have
too many points for this to be displayed cleanly.

A less frequently used visualisation for multidimensional data is the
scatterplot grid. Here, each scatterplot is the data for any pair of variables
corresponding to the rows and columns. Along the diagonal is the histogram for
values on that particular dimension. 

This visualisation shows the effectiveness of scatterplots for large amounts of
data. This helped inform our final design. However, we thought that while this
was useful at ascertaining trends for pairs of variables, our most important
visual queries requires us to compare points on three or four dimensions rather
than just two.

### 3D Visualisations

The experiment is restricted to three drugs, due to physical limitations in
conducting the experiment and also for a simpler analysis of the results. The
three drugs can easily be represented in three dimensional (3D) space, and we
began to explore 3D visualisations. Although these are a good starting point,
one needs to be careful as to how the fourth variable, the intensity of the
Green Flourescent Protein (GRP) is represented.  A naive selection of 3D
visualisation may not support the visual query for detecting this intensity, but
instead hide it. A common visualisation used to represent four dimensional data
is a 3D surface diagram as seen in Figure 7 where colour is used on the surface
itself to represent the fourth variable - much like a heatmap. We discovered
that this type of visualisation was in fact being used in reports to illustrate
results for 3D Assay data.

There are many pitfalls to this type of visualisation, one of them is that the
surface occludes itself, hiding colours.  The other is that it is very difficult
to determine the 3D coordinates of a point on the surface, and the value of the
actual colour! Another pitfall is that the surface is a continuous interpolation
of the discrete quantities, and we cannot tell which quantities were actually
used.

<center>
![alt text][example-4d-visualisation_03]

**Figure 7**: A three dimensional plot with a fourth dimension shown as colour [5]
</center>

We began exploring other 3D visualisations, such as the 3D scatterplot in Figure
8. This visualisation is favourable to the 3D surface visualisation both because
it does not occlude itself and because the scatter points are discrete.
However, on close inspection there are a few potential issues with visual
queries. The first is that the points are drawn without perspective (i.e from an
orthographic projection) which provides no visual information about where the
point lies on the scatterplot. This is complicated further when points are
clustered together. One solution to this problem is to draw lines from the
points to the planes of the axes as seen in Figure 9, however this adds too much
noise to the image, hampering visual queries.

## Requirements and Associated Visual Queries

### Analysis of Requirements
As we outlined in the Profiles of Users, we have two main use cases for each of our
users:
- **Data exploration**: what happened with this experiment? Was it successful? 
- **Data presentation**: how do I communicate the findings from this experiment?

Data exploration means that we need to be able to facilitate a high level
overview of the experiment as a whole as well as providing a way for users to
drill into the detail of what happened in the experiment. Data presentation
means that we need to produce high quality diagrams that can be edited to
provide just the information required.

To determine whether an experiment has been successful in this case is to find
drug combinations that have synergy togther or have antagonistic reactions.
Synergy means that together they work better than either of them alone at the
same concentration.  Antagonism means the opposite: the drugs together at a
certain concentration actually work less effectively than either by itself.

We also want to optimise for dosage of the drug. The lower the dosage of the
total drug combination, the lower the cost to produce that drug. Therefore it's
not just raw efficacy that's desired, but a combination of low dosage and high
efficacy. The dosage of drug combinations are generally compared using the
Fractional Inhibitry Concentration Index (referred here simply as FIC index) of that
combination - a linear sum of the drug concentrations weighted according to the
Minimum Inhibry Concentration (MIC). See Addendum A for calculating these
values. 

At a high level, this means that success is determining the trends of
combination of the dosages of the drugs. For example, we'd want to know whether
increasing the dose of FA is in general more effective than increasing the dose
of INH. We would also want to determine if there is any antagonistic reactions in the
data as a whole - is there any particular dish where increasing dosage decreases
effectiveness? Once particular points of interest have been identified, lower
level data is required to reenforce.  

### Ranked Visual Queries

In terms of prioritisation, we thought that data exploration was more important
than data presentation. The users in question have access to the raw data and
are skilled enough to provide effective two dimensional visualisations but
struggle with visualising high dimensional data. Therefore it's more important
for us to provide a visualisation that allows them to explore the three
dimensioanl data as they currently have no way to do this themselves.

Below is a ranked list of visual queries, from most important to least
important. Here, we define a drug combination as being most effective if it is
the combination of drugs that inhibits the growth of TB with the lowest FIC
index.

- Which drug combination is the most effective?
- What, if any, drugs interacted antagonistically?
- Which drug pairs were the most effective?
- Which drug was most effective by itself? 
- For a set concentration for a pair of drugs, what is the lowest dosage of the
remaining drug such that it still inhibits the growth of TB?
- As we increase the concentration of a drug, how does that generally affect the
performance of the other drug combinations?

## Design

### Initial Designs

We put together mockups for alternate 3D visualisations, one of which is
depicted in Figure 10 as a 3D bar chart.  The two horizontal axes are for RIF and
INH, while the height represents the GFP luminosity. A slider is used for
interaction of the independent variable FA and the height of the bars animates
accordingly to illustrate how the GFP luminosity is affected. This visualisation
suffers severely from occlusion and was not explored further.  A follow up idea
was to represent the concentrations of FA, RIF and INH as points on a 3D
scatterplot with a green material, slightly blurred, to indicate the GFP
luminosity shown in Figure 10. As before, it was hard to tell where the points lay on the
scatterplot, especially since they had varying degrees of luminosity and blur.
Another issue was that we were not interested in high luminosity values, but
rather low luminosity values. These lower luminosity values would be barely
visible against the background. This design clearly opposed our visual queries.

<center>
![alt text][early-design-3d-bar-chart]
![alt text][early-design-3d-scatterplot]

**Figure 10:** Our initial 3D designs
</center>

We began to realise that a single 3D diagram would not be sufficient in
analysing the results. Two dimensional (2D) visualisations would likely be
needed alongside a 3D diagram. This would allow us to keep the 3D visualisation
simple and use it, for example, in visual queries that compare the results of
neighbouring points and plates (i.e. the physical space!).  The 2D visualisation
could then be used for the variables most critical in decision making (i.e. the
logic).

We identified the two variables critical to analysing the results, which would
be used in the 2D visualisation. These are the intensity of the Green
Flourescent Protein (i.e. the Luminosity) and the FIC index.  A 2D scatterplot would
contain the visual queries needed to make accurate comparisons of the two
variables, using all the cells. We are interested in the point which has the
lowest FIC index and the lowest Luminosity: a point very close to the origin.
This satisfies our logical decision making in identifying the best point from
the experiment, all we need is to map this 2D point back to the cell containing
the 3 concentration values: a 3D point.

The 3D visualisation was then designed exactly for this mapping. It serves the
visual queries which help to identify the exact cell which we are interested in
on the plates. Necessarily, it made sense to use the physical association of the
cells and the plates in the visualisation. We chose to represent planes in the
3D space as these plates, stacked vertically on top of one another. The
concentration of FA only differs by plate, while the concentrations of RIF and
INH differ by cell. This makes the FA concentration a good candidate for the
vertical distance between the stacked plates, while RIF and INH are well suited
for the two dimensions that define the plane.

The first design for the 3D visualisation used a physical association between
the stacked planes and the plates.  A plane in 3D takes up zero area along its
normal vector (the axis running perpendicularly through the plane), whereas the
plane itself is divided into square cells with non-zero surface areas. This
meant that the discrete values for RIF and INH would be represented by cells
with length of, say, Y that would span a 2D surface with area YxY.  In contrast,
the discrete FA value would take up zero area. Our initial concern was that this
discrepancy in surface area taken up between the three drug concentrations would
be misleading to the user, and for this reason the first iteration of the design
shown in Figure 11 represents the points as cubes instead of planes.

<center>
![alt text][early-design-plate-iterations]

**Figure 11**: Our design as presented to the class
</center>

However, this introduced several issues that was picked up during our
presentation to the class. The most important issue is that it deviated from the
physical association of the plates. We had now also added more occlusion, which
is most prominent on the lower lying plates since those have similar
concentration values. Deciding that the use of cubes with equal surface area was
unjustified, the second iteration used flat planes. This clearly simplifies the
visual query, as the thickness of the planes is of no relevance, but we still
had an occlusion problem. Fortunately, the Luminosity values from the initial
spreadsheet are either 65000 or range between 20000 and 23000.  This is an
almost binary jump in value, indicating that the concentrations either have no
effect at all or a similar effect.  For the most part we are not interested in
concentrations which have no effect, so a slider was introduced to filter these
cells out of the visual query, and in so doing solve our occlusion problem.

The visualisation is also the subject of a similar issue to the discrepancy in
surface area - a spatial discrepancy.  The squares in the plane represent the
physical cells of the plate, and sit alongside one another regardless of the
difference in concentration to their neighbouring cells. At the same time the
plates are vertically stacked with a distance proportional to the FA
concentration. A quick drawing was done to visualise what it would look like if
we were to separate the cells according to their spatial relativity, but this
would clearly break down the physical association completely and degrade the
visualisation into a 3D scatterplot with squares as points - an issue in itself.

The proportionate stacking distance added no value to the physical association
in the visual query and still had the occlusion problem. As a result the design
was refactored to use uniform vertical spacing, obliterating occlusion and
associating plates in the order of their FA value. This design was implemented
in draft in Figure 12.

![alt text][early-implementation-plates-stacked_02]

**Figure 12**: The 3D visualisation taking into account feedback from the class,
solving the issues with occlusion and spatial disparity.
</center>

The final problem of colour differentiation would be tackled during
implementation. With the designs of our 3D and 2D visualisations in place, we
could focus on laying them both alongside one another. Since this was going to
be displayed on a web page, a simple web based grid layout was chosen as
depicted in Figure 13.

<center>
![alt text][sketch-layout]

**Figure 13**: The initial layout design
</center>

In the top-middle of Figure 13 is a grid with the 'frontier', values with the
lowest FIC index that inhibited the drug growth, and hyperbolic curve currently used
for analysing data as illustrated in Figure 3. The point on the hyperbolic
curve whose distance is closest to the origin represents the cell with the
optimum FIC index to Luminosity values. On the bottom right is a horizontal, 1
dimensional graph which was designed to plot this distance. It extracts the
distance value out of the 2D graph and onto the 1D graph for an easier visual
query.  The hyperbolic curve, and consequently the 1D graph, have been made
redundant by the 2D scatterplot visualisation and have since been removed. The
2D illustration of the 'frontier', however, has been kept and a slider for the
FA value has been included to interact with and observe the change in Luminosity
values between the plate concentrations of FA.

The highlighted point on the scatterplot is associated to the highlighted cell
on the 3D visualisation as being the most optimum FIC index to Luminosity value, and
illustrates the use of colour highlighting to map points on the scatterplot to
cells on the plates.

### Walkthrough of Current Design

#### Overview

The design should help the visual queries by composing the different diagrams in such a way that extracting
visual information is easy. Inappropriately placed diagrams can compete against one another for
visual attention and lead the eye away from critical data. Viewer's of film and animation generally require
three seconds of exposure to a shot before understanding what's happening in it. Similarly, the design
should allow the user to grasp the visual queries after three seconds of exposure to it, including how to
interact with it.

The initial design had reserved four spaces in the layout for diagrams. During development it became
clear that two of the diagrams would become obsolete: The horizontal FIC distance, and the Hyperbolic curve
representing the 'Frontier' points. This wasn't seen as a problem, as we had decided to include an area
for filters which would take the form of sliders and could easily replace the FIC distance diagram. The
'Frontier' points were overlayed onto the plate diagram and so this had no effect on the layout if it were
to be left out.

#### Mouse Interactions

The mouse is the only form of interaction with the web page. Since it is a pointing device it is only
able to focus on one point at any give time which could be problematic if the diagrams were isolated
components - no visual relationships could be drawn to connect the information in the three diagrams.
It was therefore necessary to highlight the pieces of information which related to what the user's
mouse was focusing on at any given point in time and on any of the diagrams. We made use of mouse hover
to identify which elements to highlight, and special care was taken with the implementation to make sure
that all the components would respond to this event at the same time.

#### Filters

The 2D scatterplot is very dense, containing points for every cell on all the plates. Making matters
worse, most of the points are clumped together. This was our initial justification for filters:
The user needed to be able to filter out ranges of data which were not relevant. The filters were
necessary to assist with the visual queries, and should not be disconnected from the visual associations
already provided by the diagrams. We chose to use range sliders to align with the axes and make use
of their existing labelling and visual association.

<center>
![alt text][design-axes-label-association]

**Figure 14**: Using axes labels to associate filters
</center>


#### Answering Queries
- Which drug combination is the most effective?
- What, if any, drugs interacted antagonistically?
- Which drug pairs were the most effective?
- Which drug was most effective by itself? 
- For a set concentration for a pair of drugs, what is the lowest dosage of the
remaining drug such that it still inhibits the growth of TB?
- As we increase the concentration of a drug, how does that generally affect the
performance of the other drug combinations?

### Motivation for Design

The visualisation is constrained to being viewed on a web page, and the user would expect a 2D layout divided
into a grid. The layout and sizing of cells in the grid make up the key features of the design, and are instrumental
in leading the eye to important visual information. The Golden ratio is well known in painting
for leading the eye into the most interesting parts of the painting and holding the viewer’s attention. This is also
known as the ‘Rule of thirds’, and for this reason both the initial design and the final implementation
honour this rule by breaking the grid up into thirds, as seen in Figure 14.


Elements with a portrait layout (i.e. are taller than they are wide), such as the 3D stacked plates, can be used to take
up a third of the horizontal space and at least two thirds vertical space. Similarly, Elements with a portrait layout 
(i.e. are wider than they are tall) can be used to take up two thirds of the horizontal space and at least a third
of the vertical space. Elements which are square in size can be used to fill in remaining space.

In order to make such an arrangement the elements needed to be analysed for their most appropriate orientation.
The 3D stacked plates would certainly only work in a portrait layout, while the 2D scatterplot was more flexible
in that it could either be used in a square or a landscape layout. The sliders are the most flexible in that they can either 
be vertically or horizontally aligned or even stacked next to one another to form a square layout. The 2D plate
diagram could be used as a square or rectangular layout.

With these orientations in mind, we considered the importance of the visual information being displayed. The 2D scatterplot
clearly had the most information and the largest value ranges. It is also used to compare and determine the most efficient
point from the test, and needs to be very accurate and usable. The 3D stacked plates gave an overall, physical illustration
of all the plates in the test, and the 2D plate gives similar information but in more detail. We chose to emphasise the
2D scatterplot by maximising its grid space and using a square layout, taking up two thirds of the screen space. The other
two diagrams would take up the remaining third, and the filters - being most flexible - would fill in. See figure 14.

<center>
![alt text][design-rule-of-thirds]

**Figure 14**: Rule of thirds used in grid
</center>

The sliders were labelled by the variables which they influenced, these are: The INH concentration, RIF concentration,
Plate number, and Luminosity filters. Coincidentally, these ranges each appeared only once across the axes of the three different
diagrams. These axes were already labelled, and the user would have established an association with them. It made sense to
position the filters such that their interaction was described by the visual association to the axes! Care was taken to place
the filters on the opposite side of the axes so they would not compete for attention of the axes’ labels.

## Analysis of Design

<center>
![alt text][design-final]

**Figure 15**: Final implemented design
</center>

The filters, without their labels, are possibly too simplistic. Although their association with the axes is very strong,
it is not visually clear that the vertical slider positioned to the right of the 3D stacked plates actually selects the
active plate which is displayed in the 2D plate diagram above it. The slider is also aligned next to the labels for the FA
concentration, which can cause an association between itself and FA concentrations - instead of the plate number. This
confusion could be avoided by introducing a plate number label next to the plate itself, and a plate number heading for the
2D plate diagram.

## Conclusions

After a number of designs, we found that the best way to visualise 4D data is to
couple a 3D visualisation which gives a high level overview with two 2D ones in
order to give large amounts of detail. The final implemented design enabled one
to easily answer a number of the high priority visual queries but did not answer
some of the mid to low priority ones without having to incorporate filtering. 

In order to be a successful, publishable visualisation for this type of data,
more work is reccomended.

An important first step for future work for this visualisation would be
verification that we have made a substantial improvement over the current
techniques. This would probably take the form of a user evalutation and
experimenetation.

In order to be widely used, the implementation of this visualisation would need
to improved substantially.  Right now, the design resides as a static
visualisation in a github repo[6]. In order for this to be useful, one would
need to at the very least
- create a data pipeline that allows researchers to add their own raw data, have
that processed and then visualised
- allow researchers to store their results
- provide an easy way for researchers to export the visualisations for inclusion
in a publication
- a "raw data" mode so that researchers can view the data in tabular or some
such format.

Due to time constraints, we were not able to explore the possibility of having
the entire visualisation in 3D, having the user able to rapidly explore entirely
in a 3D space. Future work could focus on using our 3D plate visualisation as a
base for other 3D visualisations of this data, allowing the user to manipulate
the camera and have other data projected in this 3D space rather than having 2D
plots augmenting it.

## Work Split

We split the work right down the middle, with each member having different
responsibilities for each of the major areas of work.

Jarred handled the design and implemention for the 3D visualisation while
Steven was responsible for the design and implemention of the 2D visualisations.
Jarred created the application scaffolding (a static javascript page) while
Steven worked on the interactive framework (allowing one to interact with
elements on the page). Jarred finalised the page layout while Steven worked on
colouring for the heatmap. Jarred wrote the sections on 3D visualisations while
Steven did the sections of 2D, with both of us colloborating on the other
sections.

This ended up working surprisingly well - we each chose sections we were
passionate about and we think that the work shows it.

## Apprendix A: Calculation of FIC Index

Here we give a brief summary of what FIC, MIC and FIC indices are and how they are
calculated. 

The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration of a drug concentration is defined
as the concentration of that drug divided by the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) of that drug[7]. The MIC of a drug is defined as the lowest
concentration of that drug such that growth of the microorganism it is targeting
is inhibited[8].

The overall concentration of a group of drugs can be grouped together using a
FIC Index which is the sum of the FIC values of the drugs in that
combination[7]. If the FIC index of a drug combination of 2 drugs is below 0.4
and inhibits a microorganism's growth then it is termed synergistic; if the FIC
index is above 1 and the microorganism's growth is not inhibited then the
combination is termed antagonistic.

To see why this is the case, consider a drug combination where two drugs each
have a FIC of 0.5. This means that each by itself is at half the concentration
normally needed to inhibit the growth of the microorganism itself. This means
that together, with a FIC index of 1, they definitely should be able to inhibit
the growth.  If they can't, then they must be combatting each other somehow and
are therefore antagonistic. If we have two drugs which each have FICs of 0.2,
then they're both far under what they would normally be required to inhibit drug
growth but if they do so together, with a FIC index of 0.4, that would indicate
that they substantially aid each others combatting of the virus in a synergistic
way.

### Useful bits

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are defined as the lowest concentration
of an antimicrobial that will inhibit the visible growth of a microorganism
after overnight incubation
